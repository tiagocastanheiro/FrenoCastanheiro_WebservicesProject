# FrenoCastanheiro_WebservicesProject

!!!!!!! PLEASE DON'T OPEN THE form1.cs FILE !!!!!!!!

It may produce errors with the user controls and the service reference, some connections may be deleted !!!

Maybe if you want to see the work done in this file, you can run the first time the app without opening it. 
When you have finished to test, you can open the file (knowing that probably it could break the app Windows Form App)

To run our windows form app, you need :
1. Open the database at WcfServiceMSSQL/App_Data/StudentsDB.mdf
2. Update the service reference : MSSQLServiceReference in Connected Services
3. Rebuild the entire solution.
4. Run the project

All calls to our webservice are done in the repository UserControls.
No calls are made into form1.cs.

For the tests, you can use 2 accounts that we have created :
UID : 11111, Username : gabriell.freno
UID : 22222, Username : tiago.garciaca
